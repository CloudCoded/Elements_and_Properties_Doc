On This Repo I Will Be Documenting Whatever New Element, Property, attributes or selector I learned While Building Projects On FreeCodeCamp OR from any other resources........

This is going to help me log the elements and properties have worked and I can always come back for reference.


<!-- HTML ELEMENTS I LEARNED TODAY ON 20TH FEB 2023 -->
<details>
    <summary>Madrid</summary>
    coach <br>
    players <br>
    non staffs...
</details> <!--This element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. The summary element must be provided inside the details-->

<figure>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure> <!-- This element represent self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. They are referenced as a single unit-->

<blockquote cite="#">
    <cite></cite> <!-- A URL for the src of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while the text rep of the src can be given using the "cite element"-->
</blockquote> <!-- This element indicates that the enclosed text is an extented quotation-->

<table> <!-- This element represents tabular data -that is, info presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data-->
<caption> <!--- This element specify the title of a table-->
<thead> <tbody> <!---The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary data or content.--->
<tr> <td> <th> <!---The tr element is used to indicate a table row. The td element indicates a data cell, while the th element indicates a header cell.--->

The i element is used for idiomatic text, or text that is separate from the "normal" text content. This could be for italic text, such as scientific terms, or for icons like those provided by FontAwesome.

This special class is how FontAwesome determines which icon to load. fas indicates the category of icons (FontAwesome Solid, here), while fa-music selects the specific icon.



The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load
